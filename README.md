# PowerAutomate_cleanRepeatedFiles
PowerAutomate script to identify/clean/move repeated files in folder/s. Check files by comparision by hash.


Accept 4 params:
- Folder (and subfolders).
- Check if you want a CSV file with the list of repeated files.
- Check if you want to "rename" with a "tag" attached to the repeated file.
- Check if you want to delete repeated files.

Obviously, some of these checks doesnt work together.

Future improvements:
  - Check to determine if you want to analyze subfolders.
  - Full english/spanish support (now some parts are in english, other in spanish).
  -  Customize CSV file name, customize "Tag" for repeated name files (in renaming option).
